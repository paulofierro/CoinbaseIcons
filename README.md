# CoinbaseIcons
![](https://github.com/paulofierro/CoinbaseIcons/blob/master/Assets/icon_76pt%402x.png)

A sample iOS app written in Swift 5 that shows [the top 50 cryptocurrencies on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/price) by scraping the data from Coinbase, parsing it with [Kanna](https://github.com/tid-kijyun/Kanna) and then displaying it in a `UICollectionView`.

Built for my [Foraging for Data](https://www.meetup.com/Swift-Miami/events/258909804/) talk at [Swift Miami](https://www.meetup.com/Swift-Miami/).
